# cisc3160lab4

Summary:
**Pseudocode** is in comments at top of source code.
**Language Reference Guide** is at the end of this README.
**Reflection** I will submit with the google form as usual.

My two goals starting this lab were to use **Haskell** and also to use **github** properly and through
the terminal for the entire process. For a second language I had a loose idea I'd use **javascript**. I've played
around with it, but never made anything substantial so I was thinking it would be a satisfying bridge for me to cross
while also letting Haskell be the ambitious bit. (I've picked up **Python** and **Ruby** for a class and an internship
this term and I am feeling a little swimmy, awash in new right now. Yet actually using one of those two seems a little 
like cheating as I've already learned quite a bit, even if in only in the last couple weeks.)

Tate writes in his Seven Languages in Seven Weeks that **Io** left him with a much better understanding of why 
javascript does things the way it does, so I explored using Io but decided javascript felt better suited to the problems to me.

**LANGUAGE REFERENCE GUIDE**

I very much began with a book for each language.
