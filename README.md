# cisc3160lab4

Summary:
**Pseudocode** is in comments at top of source code.

**Language Reference Guide** is at the end of this README.

**Reflection** I will submit with the google form as usual.

I wish this were more complete, but the process has been great for me.
6 Project Euler problems solved in javascript

3 in Haskell (1,2,4) though I may crack another before the deadline!
Unfortunately they are in various states of cleanup and documentation. I'll leave my comments to the reflection.

My two goals starting this lab were to use **Haskell** and also to use **github** properly and through
the terminal for the entire process. For a second language I had a loose idea I'd use **javascript**. I've played
around with it, but never made anything substantial so I was thinking it would be a satisfying bridge for me to cross
while also letting Haskell be the ambitious bit. (I've picked up **Python** and **Ruby** for a class and an internship
this term and I am feeling a little swimmy, awash in new right now. Yet actually using one of those two seems a little 
like cheating as I've already learned quite a bit, even if in only in the last couple weeks.)

Tate writes in his Seven Languages in Seven Weeks that **Io** left him with a much better understanding of why 
javascript does things the way it does, so I explored using Io but decided javascript felt better suited to the problems to me.

**LANGUAGE REFERENCE GUIDE**

I very much began with a book for each language.

  **Haskell Resources**

*Seven Languages in Seven Days*, Bruce Tate

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fhBAy8bj6ljAAwHXSa2DIIWEk3eF9Snd
(This link is from class website! Though I've downloaded it for frequent visiting.)
-- I love this book. It really helped me crack the repl idea: how to use it to answer your own question and 
puzzle out debugging issues.

wiki.haskell.org
-- Good for seeing examples of how others work.

https://jutge.org/doc/haskell-cheat-sheet.pdf  
  -- This was the best "one-page" (it's actually quite a few...) look up I found to just scan for how things look.
  I found myself returning to it when something I thought should work wouldn't. When the REPL didn't answer my questions
  often looking here for style would.



  **JavaScript Resources**

*Eloquent JavaScript*, Marjin Heverbeke

https://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html

-- He cracks me up. I remembered this from years ago and really enjoyed returning to it with a foundation
to understand the choices he makes.

w3schools.com

-- Great index on the left hand side. Best quick look up of basics.


https://ilovecoding.org/blog/js-cheatsheet

-- Like my third Haskell reference, this is where I went to scan style when I was stumped.
