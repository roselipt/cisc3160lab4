# cisc3160lab4

My two solid goals starting this lab were to use *Haskell* and also to use *github* properly and through
the terminal for the entire process. For a second language I had a loose idea I'd use *javascript*. I've played
around with it, but never made anything substantial so I was thinking it would be a satisfying bridge for me to cross
while also not overly ambitious. (I've picked up Python and Ruby for a class and an internship this term and I am
feeling a little swimmy, awash in new right now. Yet actually using one of those two seems a little like cheating
as I've written real programs in them, even in only in the last couple weeks.

Tate writes in his Seven Languages in Seven Weeks that Io left him with a much better understanding of why 
javascript does things the way it does, so I decided that was just the thing.
